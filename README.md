# Nickname-Generator-Names

HTML page for a "Nickname Generator." It generates random nicknames with a preference for more vowels. The web page consists of a heading, introductory text, and a button to generate a nickname. When the button is clicked, a JavaScript function is triggered to generate a random nickname based on a predefined vowel-to-consonant ratio. The generated nickname is displayed on the page. The HTML is styled with CSS to provide a visually appealing layout.
